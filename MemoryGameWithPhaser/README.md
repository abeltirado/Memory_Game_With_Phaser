# Memory Game with Phaser

Hello, my name is Abel, and this is a description of what this project is about.

## Description

This project is the classic memory game. I have used a framework called Phaser, which is a tool that works with Canvas and WebGL, thereby improving the rendering of games in web browsers.

My code is based on the manual "From Null to Full HTML5 Cross Platform Game" by EMANUELE FERONATO. I have used a large part of his code and made some improvements from there.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

## Usage

To view and play the game, it is recommended to use the Live Server plugin from Visual Studio Code, as it is a very intuitive and easy-to-use tool. Additionally, Live Server allows you to see real-time changes while developing the game's functionalities.

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser. 
2. If you are using `http-server`, access the provided URL (default is `http://localhost:8080`).
